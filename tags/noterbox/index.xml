      <description>Hey, what&amp;rsquo;s up, I am Gabriel - and I am building NoterBox.
  I have started working on NoterBox to solve a personal problem:
I needed a long term secure solution to store and manage my personal data. And I needed to be able to easily capture new data from several sources, as well as search that data. In other words, a PIM for the 21st century.
I need to know when exactly I have sent out that certificate for authentication (was it 4 or 6 weeks ago?</description>

      <description>During lifetime, a lot of personal information gets misplaced or just lost. We are saving &amp;ldquo;some&amp;rdquo; of our information in several places - online or offline. In time, data becomes difficult to find &amp;amp; manage.
What were you doing on March 14th of 2012? When was your last doctor appointment and where? How much have you spent on repairs for your car so far?
The majority of people are not able to answer such questions.</description>
