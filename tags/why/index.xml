      <description>Hey, what&amp;rsquo;s up, I am Gabriel - and I am building NoterBox.
  I have started working on NoterBox to solve a personal problem:
I needed a long term secure solution to store and manage my personal data. And I needed to be able to easily capture new data from several sources, as well as search that data. In other words, a PIM for the 21st century.
I need to know when exactly I have sent out that certificate for authentication (was it 4 or 6 weeks ago?</description>
